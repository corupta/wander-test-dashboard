# wander-test-dashboard

This repo contains data plot dashboards and a socket server.
I used it to visualize all sensor data collected from mobile device, 
so that I can find some correlations between phone shake/rotate behaviour 
and sensor data in a way I should be able to plot drawn spell shape.

After many tryouts, I was able to obtain some fine experience, 
in which I can pretty much draw stuff on the browser by moving my mobile phone.

Refer to [@corupta/wander-app sensor-test branch](https://github.com/corupta/wander-app/tree/sensor-test)
which connects to the socket server provided, please change IPs in both repos to your IP when trying. 
(It is not generalized because it is for testing/playground purposes, only)
